## Hi there 👋

I'm Philip, a data analyst based in Mississippi.

I enjoy designing and building projects around my interests: music, sports, business, and crypto.

My main tech stack is:
  - SQL (PostgreSQL)
  - Python
  - APIs & data pipelines
  - Dashboards & data visualization
  - Docker, Metabase, DBeaver

I'm currently working on an analytics project exploring listener engagement and lyrical patterns from A$AP Rocky’s *Don’t Be Dumb* album using public APIs and SQL.
